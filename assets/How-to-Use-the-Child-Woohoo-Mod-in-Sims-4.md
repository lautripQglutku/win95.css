## What is the Child Woohoo Mod?
 
The child woohoo mod is a custom content created by Rootanola, a Sims 4 modder. It unlocks romance and marriage options for kids and teens, as well as woohoo for teens. The mod is designed to simulate the first love experience of young sims, with age-appropriate animations and interactions. The mod also adds pregnancy and fertility features for teens, such as risky woohoo, menstrual cycle, and abortion.
 
## How to Install the Child Woohoo Mod?
 
To install the child woohoo mod, you need to download the latest version from Rootanola's Nexus Mods page[^1^] or YouTube channel[^2^]. There are two versions of the mod: v1.0 and v2.0. The v1.0 version only allows romance and marriage for kids and teens, while the v2.0 version also enables woohoo for teens. You can choose whichever version suits your preference.
 
After downloading the mod file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named "Child Woohoo Mod" with two subfolders: "Child Romance" and "Teen Woohoo". You need to copy both subfolders and paste them into your Mods folder in your Sims 4 directory. The default location of the Mods folder is Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.
 
Once you have installed the mod, you need to enable script mods and custom content in your game settings. To do this, go to Options > Game Options > Other and check the boxes for "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed". Then restart your game for the changes to take effect.
 
## How to Use the Child Woohoo Mod?
 
To use the child woohoo mod, you need to have a child or teen sim who has a crush on another sim of the same age group. You can make them have a crush by using the "Confess Crush" interaction under the Friendly category. Once they have a crush, they can exchange phone numbers, hug, kiss on the cheek, hold hands, stargaze, goof around, propose to be partners, text, call, and grow together into teens.
 
If you have installed the v2.0 version of the mod, you can also make your teen sims woohoo with their partners. To do this, you need to have a bed or a tent on your lot. Then click on the bed or tent and choose the "Woohoo with..." option. You can also choose the "Try for Baby" option if you want your teen sims to get pregnant. However, be aware that there is a risk of pregnancy even if you choose the regular woohoo option.
 
If your teen sim gets pregnant, they will have a visible baby bump and go through trimesters like adult sims. They can also take a pregnancy test, announce their pregnancy, have mood swings, cravings, and morning sickness. If they do not want to keep the baby, they can choose to terminate the pregnancy by clicking on themselves and selecting the "Abortion" option under the Health category.
