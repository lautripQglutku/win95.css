WWE WrestleMania 24 was also notable for being the first WrestleMania to be broadcast in high definition. The event featured a spectacular pyrotechnic display, including a giant ring-shaped structure that was set on fire during The Undertaker's entrance. The event also had a live musical performance by Snoop Dogg, who sang "Sensual Seduction" and "America the Beautiful".
 
Some of the highlights of the event were:
 
- The Undertaker vs. Edge: This was a classic match between two of the best performers in WWE history. The Undertaker and Edge had a long and bitter rivalry that culminated at WrestleMania 24. The match was a back-and-forth affair, with both men hitting their signature moves and kicking out of each other's finishers. The match ended when The Undertaker locked Edge in his submission hold, the Hell's Gate, and forced him to tap out.
- Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels: This was an emotional match that marked the end of Ric Flair's legendary career. Flair had been given an ultimatum by Vince McMahon: if he lost any match, he would have to retire. Flair chose Shawn Michaels, his friend and admirer, as his opponent at WrestleMania 24. The match was a tribute to Flair's legacy, as both men showed respect and admiration for each other. The match ended when Michaels hit Flair with his superkick, the Sweet Chin Music, and said "I'm sorry, I love you" before pinning him.
- Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Big Show: This was a rare match between a professional boxer and a professional wrestler. Mayweather, who was the WBC welterweight champion at the time, agreed to face Big Show, who was one of the largest and strongest wrestlers in WWE history. The match was a no disqualification match, which meant that anything goes. Mayweather used his speed and agility to avoid Big Show's attacks, while Big Show used his power and size to overpower Mayweather. The match ended when Mayweather hit Big Show with a brass knuckles punch and knocked him out.
