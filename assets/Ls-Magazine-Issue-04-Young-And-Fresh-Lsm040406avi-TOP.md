With V-Ray Vision, you can enjoy a live real-time view of your Rhino and Grasshopper designs as you create them. You can see how your model looks with different materials and lighting settings, and make adjustments on the fly. V-Ray Vision lets you explore your design ideas in real-time and get instant feedback. You can also share your V-Ray Vision result with others by packaging it into a standalone file that they can open and experience in the same way as you did in Rhino.

V-Ray Vision is a powerful tool that helps you design faster and better. You can use it to preview your Rhino and Grasshopper models in real-time, without waiting for rendering. You can also switch between different views, such as perspective, orthographic, or panoramic, and navigate your scene with ease.
  
V-Ray Vision supports a wide range of materials and lighting effects that you can apply to your models. You can choose from hundreds of predefined materials, or create your own custom ones. You can also adjust the sun and sky settings, add artificial lights, and control the exposure and white balance of your scene. You can see how your materials and lighting affect your model in real-time, and fine-tune them to achieve the best results.
  
V-Ray Vision also allows you to share your work with others in an interactive way. You can export your V-Ray Vision result as a standalone file that anyone can open and explore on their own device. You can also stream your V-Ray Vision result to a web browser or a VR headset, and invite others to join you in a collaborative session. You can communicate with them via voice or text chat, and show them your design from different angles.
