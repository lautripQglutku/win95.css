Despite the film's ending leaving room for a potential sequel, Ninja Assassin 2 never materialized. According to McTeigue, the reason was that Warner Bros. did not want to invest in another R-rated action film after the disappointing performance of Watchmen (2009), another film produced by the Wachowskis. McTeigue also said that he had some ideas for a sequel, but they were never developed further.
 
However, fans of Ninja Assassin can still enjoy the film in different languages, including Hindi. The film was dubbed in Hindi and released on DVD and online platforms in India. The Hindi dub features voice actors who match the original actors' voices and emotions. The dub also retains the original soundtrack and sound effects, creating an immersive experience for the viewers.
